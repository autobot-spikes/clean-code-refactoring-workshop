# Clean Code Refactoring Workshop

This refactoring is based on the book "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" written by Martin Fowler.

You can start with the Java version or the Typescript version.

## Java version

```sh
cd java
./gradlew build
```

## Typescript version

```sh
cd typescript
npm install
npm test
```
